Modular JavaScript Applications
============
*Haymarket Dev Meetup - July 2012*

The code in the example is by no means perfect - I took a "whatever-works" approach to writing the code, so there are definitely some bugs and a couple design kludges.

The main idea I'm trying to get across with the code is the ability to create **structured and organized JavaScript**. The code is logically-separated and easy to just dive into and figure out.
